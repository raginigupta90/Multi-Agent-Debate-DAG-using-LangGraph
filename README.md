# Multi-Agent Debate (LangGraph-style) — Demo Implementation

This project implements the ATG assignment: a LangGraph-style debate DAG where two agents (Scientist vs Philosopher)
alternate for 8 rounds, memory nodes maintain short summaries, and a Judge node produces a final verdict.
This version runs locally on Windows inside a Python venv and uses deterministic simulated agent generators (no LLM required).

I also included a Demo Video for better understanding please have a look on above code files, there is a file included **Demo video.wmb**

## Files
- `main.py` — CLI entry point.
- `nodes.py` — node implementations (UserInput, Agent A/B, Memory, Judge).
- `graph_builder.py` — builds a LangGraph `StateGraph` (structural).
- `dag_viz.py` — generates a DAG PNG via `graphviz`.
- `logger_util.py` — logs every step & state transitions to `logs/`.
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies.

## Windows + venv setup (step-by-step)
1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Create virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

3. Activate venv:
- PowerShell:
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
- Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```
4. Upgrade pip and install requirements:


python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If `langgraph` asks for a pre-release as in docs do:


pip install --pre -U langgraph


5. Install Graphviz system binary (needed to render PNG):
- Download Graphviz for Windows: https://graphviz.org/download/
- Add Graphviz `bin` folder to your PATH (restart shell after editing PATH).

## Run


python main.py

or provide topic directly:


python main.py --topic "Should AI be regulated like medicine?"


CLI output includes each round and the final Judge verdict. A detailed log file is created under `logs/`.

## What is implemented
- Exactly 8 rounds (4 per agent), strict alternation enforced by the driver.
- Memory node updates and per-agent memory (agents do not see full transcript).
- No argument repeats (exact text) — we mark used argument strings.
- Judge node heuristics that examine transcript and memory to pick a winner and justification.
- Full logging of nodes, state dumps, and judge outputs into `logs/`.
- DAG diagram (PNG) generated by `dag_viz.py`.

## Extending to real LLMs / LangGraph runtime
This implementation uses stateless function-based nodes for clarity and local runs. If you want to call real LLMs:
- Replace `agent_generate_argument()` with calls to an LLM wrapper (LangChain or direct OpenAI).
- In `requirements.txt` add `openai` and `langchain` as needed.
- Alternatively, use LangGraph's runtime/compile APIs to run the graph instead of the simple unrolled driver.

## Submission artifacts to include
- Source code files (this repo)
- `logs/` with the generated `debate_log_*.txt`
- DAG PNG (`dag.png`)
- Demo video (2–4 minutes) walking through the code, running `main.py`, showing logs and DAG.

## Notes / Caveats
- This demo intentionally simulates agent responses for reliability and to avoid requiring API keys.
- The judge uses a simple heuristic scoring. You can replace it with an LLM-based judge or more advanced logic for stronger evaluations.


Sample run (what you should see)

> python main.py --topic "Should AI be regulated like medicine?"

Console:

Starting debate between Scientist and Philosopher on: Should AI be regulated like medicine?
[Round 1] Scientist: Because medical diagnosis systems creates demonstrable, measurable risks that can harm humans, AI should be regulated to ensure safety and accountability.
[Round 2] Philosopher: Regulating medical diagnosis systems like medicine could limit intellectual freedom and slow valuable philosophical inquiry.
[Round 3] Scientist: High-risk applications like autonomous weapons need oversight — regulation would require testing, monitoring, and rollback procedures.
...
[Round 8] Philosopher: Historical overregulation has sometimes delayed progress; careful, flexible approaches are better than medical-style regulation for medical diagnosis systems.

[Judge] Summary of debate (short):
['Topic: Should AI be regulated like medicine?', 'Transcript summary (round by round):', 'R1 Scientist: Because medical diagnosis systems ...', 'R2 Philosopher: Regulating medical diagnosis systems ...', ...]

[Judge] Winner: Scientist
Reason: sci_score=10, phil_score=6 -> winner: Scientist
