[2025-09-21 12:32:03] Starting debate between Scientist and Philosopher
[2025-09-21 12:32:03] Validating turn: round 1 expected Scientist
[2025-09-21 12:32:03] [Round 1] Scientist: High-risk applications like automated hiring systems need oversight — regulation would require testing, monitoring, and rollback procedures.

[2025-09-21 12:32:03] Validating turn: round 2 expected Philosopher
[2025-09-21 12:32:03] [Round 2] Philosopher: Rigid regulation may entrench existing paradigms and prevent emergent, beneficial experimentation with automated hiring systems.

[2025-09-21 12:32:04] [Round 4] Philosopher: Regulation risks overreach: moral and ethical questions about autonomous weapons may not be solvable by technical rules alone.
